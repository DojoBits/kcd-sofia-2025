GitOps is a modern approach to managing cloud native infrastructure, transforming operations by leveraging Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application management. This hands-on workshop explores how ArgoCD brings GitOps principles into practice, enabling automated delivery and continuous reconciliation within Kubernetes environments.
